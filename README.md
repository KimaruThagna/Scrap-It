# Scrap-It
A repo on simple web scrapping using Python, pandas and Beautiful soup
To fetch images, one needs their urls. To automate this process, we use selenium to simulate a user scrolling through the google image search.
The end goal is to automatically build an image dataset that can be used for a computer vision or object detection training task.
